A collection of algorithms in multiple languages.

## Searching
- Linear search
- binary search
- substring search (quadratic, Rabin-Karp, Boyer-Moore, Knuth-Morris-Pratt)
- trie
- Aho-Corasick

## Sorting
- quadratic sorting (bubble, insertion)
- quick sort
- merge sort
- heap sort

## Data Structures
### Arrays and Lists
- growable array (aka ArrayList, vector)
- doubly-linked list

### Heaps
- binary heap

### Trees
- binary search tree
- avl tree
- red-black tree
- B-tree
- splay tree
- trie (also in search)

### Hash Tables
- hash table (chaining and open addressing)

## Graph
### Traversal
- depth first search (DFS)
- breadth first search (BFS)

### Topological Processing
- topological sort
- strongly connected components

### Shortest Path
- breadth first search (unweighted)
- Dijkstra
- Floyd-Warshall
- Bellman-Ford

### Spanning Trees
- Minimal spanning tree:
- Prim's algorithm
- Kruskal's algorithm

## Dynamic Programming
- longest common subsequence
- edit distance
